The formula for linear regression is as follows: \\(Y = b_{0} + b_{1}X + error\\) While this can look confusing, each component of this equation can be reduced to a simpler explanation. \\(Y\\) = dependent variable (also known as the outcome variable) \\(X\\) = independent variable (also known as the predictor variable) \\(b_{0}\\) = regression constant (also known as the slope) \\(b_{1}\\) = regression coefficient \\(error\\) = measure of residuals which is the difference between the predicted and actual values. 4.2 In R "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

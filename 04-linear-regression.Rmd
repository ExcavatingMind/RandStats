# Linear regression

## Mathematical understanding of simple linear regression

### brief introduction

Simple linear regression, or linear regression, is a statistical method that can examine the influence of **one** independent variable on **one** dependent variable. The formula for linear regression is as follows:

$Y = b_{0} + b_{1}X + error$

While this can look confusing, each component of this equation can be reduced to a simpler explanation. 

- $Y$ = dependent variable (also known as the outcome variable)
- $X$ = independent variable (also known as the predictor variable)
- $b_{0}$ = regression constant (also known as the slope)
- $b_{1}$ = regression coefficient
- $error$ = measure of residuals which is the difference between the predicted and actual values.
